### What

For Lab 3 I had to create three tasks using p5.js. For the first task, I had to draw a quad that is rotated 35 degrees and has a background colour of blue with no stroke. For the second task, I had to draw a rectangle with rounded corners, no background colour with a stroke weight of 6 that was the colour red. For the third task I had to create two 3D shapes, a cylinder and a ellipsoid.

### Why

This is an important skill to learn and understand as it allows me to be more creative when designing and developing a website. I find p5.js as a gimmick at times, but it can be quite helpful for adding detail and designs to a website. p5.js is also good to practice as it allows me to have a greater understanding of other JavaScript library's that are available for a range of ideas. 

### How

By learning how to use this skill effectively I am able to create objects that look great. While developing this skill I learnt that p5.js had a render add on for creating 3D shapes. You can add 'WEBGL' to a shape and it will render the shape in 3D. While learning this skill I had no difficulty figuring out a solution to these tasks, as I had the ability to use the p5.js referece guide on their website. As long as I reference where I got ideas from correctly, their is not issues with doing this.
